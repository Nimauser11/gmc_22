# Implementation plan

## Phase 1: Environment Setup

1.  Create a new project repository called `kpix-ai-growth-coach` and initialize Git (**Project Overview: Next Steps**).
2.  Set up a monorepo structure with `/frontend` and `/backend` directories at the project root (**Project Overview: Implementation Considerations**).
3.  Verify that Node.js is installed on your system; if not, install Node.js (latest LTS recommended) and confirm installation with `node -v` (**Project Overview: Tech Stack - Backend**).
4.  Ensure that React is installed for the frontend; create a new React app in the `/frontend` directory using Create React App or a similar boilerplate (**Project Overview: Tech Stack - Frontend**).
5.  Create a `.env` file in the project root to hold environment variables (e.g. API keys for Stripe, Shopify, GA4, LinkedIn) (**Project Overview: Implementation Considerations**).
6.  **Validation**: Run the repository tests (if any later configured) to ensure the environment is set up correctly.

## Phase 2: Frontend Development

1.  Create the main dashboard component at `/frontend/src/components/UnifiedDashboard.jsx` that will integrate data visualization components (**Project Overview: Key Features - Unified Growth Dashboard**).
2.  Design the dashboard UI with a Taylor Swift-inspired aesthetic using the color palette and typography guidelines in your design specs (**Project Overview: Key Features - Taylor Swift-Inspired Design**).
3.  Implement responsive layouts and modern design patterns using the UI component libraries referenced (inspired by V0 by Vercel and Create XYZ) (**Project Overview: Tech Stack - Frontend**).
4.  Create a component at `/frontend/src/components/NLPQuery.jsx` to handle user natural language queries using Langtrace NLP (**Project Overview: Key Features - Natural Language Processing (NLP)**).
5.  Develop form components with appropriate input validation for role-based access login at `/frontend/src/components/LoginForm.jsx` (**Project Overview: Key Features - Role-Based Access**).
6.  Integrate notification UI elements (for email, Slack, and in-app alerts) at `/frontend/src/components/Notifications.jsx` (**Project Overview: Key Features - Notifications & Reports**).
7.  **Validation**: Launch the frontend locally with `npm start` and verify that the dashboard and form components render correctly.

## Phase 3: Backend Development

1.  In the `/backend` directory, initialize a Node.js project and install necessary dependencies (Express, pg, OAuth2 libraries, etc.) (**Project Overview: Tech Stack - Backend**).
2.  Set up an Express server in `/backend/server.js` to handle API requests (**Project Overview: Implementation Considerations**).
3.  Configure a PostgreSQL database connection using the `pg` library and store credentials securely in environment variables (**Project Overview: Tech Stack - Backend; Data Security & Privacy**).
4.  Create API endpoints to fetch and update KPI data at `/backend/routes/kpiRoutes.js`; include endpoints for the unified dashboard data retrieval (**Project Overview: Key Features - Unified Growth Dashboard**).
5.  Implement a POST API endpoint `/api/v1/nlp-query` in `/backend/routes/nlpRoutes.js` that processes natural language queries via Langtrace (**Project Overview: Key Features - NLP**).
6.  Integrate OAuth2 authentication endpoints in `/backend/routes/authRoutes.js` to secure API access; include role handling for Founders, Team Members, Investors, and Data Analysts (**Project Overview: Key Features - Role-Based Access; Data Security & Privacy**).
7.  Develop integration endpoints to communicate with external APIs for Stripe, Shopify, GA4, LinkedIn, and Apify at `/backend/routes/externalRoutes.js` (**Project Overview: Key Features - Competitor Intelligence, Monetization, and Integrations**).
8.  Create a service in `/backend/services/videoReportService.js` to interface with OpenHands for generating automated video reports (**Project Overview: Key Features - Personalized Video Reporting**).
9.  Add error handling middleware in `/backend/middleware/errorHandler.js` to ensure graceful error messages across the APIs (**Project Overview: Key Features - Error handling**).
10. **Validation**: Run API endpoint tests using Postman or a test suite (e.g., Jest) to ensure endpoints respond correctly (expect 200 status where applicable).

## Phase 4: Integration

1.  Connect the frontend to the backend by setting up API calls using Axios in `/frontend/src/services/api.js` (**Project Overview: Integration & Next Steps**).
2.  Ensure that the Unified Growth Dashboard component calls the `/api/v1/kpi-data` endpoint to load data on startup (**Project Overview: Key Features - Unified Growth Dashboard**).
3.  Integrate the NLP component by wiring it to the `/api/v1/nlp-query` endpoint with proper error handling (**Project Overview: Key Features - NLP**).
4.  Implement client-side authentication flows that interact with the OAuth2 endpoints from the backend; store tokens securely using httpOnly cookies (**Project Overview: Key Features - Role-Based Access; Data Security & Privacy**).
5.  Configure CORS in the backend (in `/backend/server.js`) to allow requests from the frontend URL (e.g., `http://localhost:3000`) (**Project Overview: Implementation Considerations**).
6.  Test integrations by running the frontend and backend together, ensuring that API calls return the expected data and errors are handled gracefully (**Project Overview: Implementation Considerations**).

## Phase 5: Deployment

1.  Prepare a production build of the frontend by running `npm run build` in the `/frontend` directory (**Project Overview: Next Steps**).
2.  Deploy the static frontend build to an AWS S3 bucket (e.g., bucket name: `kpix-frontend-assets` in region `us-east-1`) (**Project Overview: Tech Stack - AWS S3**).
3.  Configure AWS CloudFront to serve the frontend assets from the S3 bucket for improved performance and security (**Project Overview: Implementation Considerations**).
4.  Deploy the Node.js backend to a cloud service (e.g., AWS Elastic Beanstalk or an EC2 instance) using configuration file `/infra/aws/elasticbeanstalk-config.yaml` (ensure secure and scalable configuration) (**Project Overview: Tech Stack - Backend; Deployment Considerations**).
5.  Set environment variables on your cloud deployment that include API keys and database credentials (**Project Overview: Data Security & Privacy**).
6.  Set up continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines (e.g., using GitHub Actions) to automate testing and deployment after code pushes (**Project Overview: Next Steps**).
7.  **Validation**: After deployment, run full end-to-end tests to ensure the unified dashboard, NLP queries, video report generation, competitor data fetching, and authentication operate correctly.

## Additional Integration and Testing

1.  Integrate real-time data updates on the dashboard using WebSocket or similar techniques for seamless KPI updates (**Project Overview: Key Features - Dynamic dashboard experience and data visualization**).
2.  Implement caching mechanisms in the backend using Redis (if needed) to manage high-frequency data requests and ensure performance scalability (**Project Overview: Implementation Considerations**).
3.  Set up automated unit and integration tests for both frontend and backend components (for example, using Jest for JavaScript testing) (**Project Overview: Implementation Considerations**).
4.  Configure audit logging in the backend to track logins, API usage, and data access as required for GDPR, CCPA, and SOC 2 compliance (**Project Overview: Data Security & Privacy**).
5.  Create a rollback plan documented in `/docs/rollback.md` for deployment issues (**Project Overview: Implementation Considerations**).

## Final Quality Checks & Launch

1.  Perform user acceptance testing (UAT) with target users (Founders, Growth Managers) to ensure usability and the Taylor Swift-inspired design meets expectations (**Project Overview: Target Audience**).
2.  Review all integrations with external APIs (Stripe, Shopify, GA4, LinkedIn, Apify, OpenHands, Langtrace) ensuring data flows correctly and securely (**Project Overview: Key Features & Implementation Considerations**).
3.  Confirm that notifications (Email, Slack, and in-app) are functioning as per the set schedules and triggers (**Project Overview: Notifications & Reports**).
4.  Document the complete system architecture and deployment process in `/docs/architecture.md` for future reference and audits (**Project Overview: Data Security & Privacy**).
5.  Set up monitoring and logging (using AWS CloudWatch or similar) to proactively manage issues once the system goes live (**Project Overview: Implementation Considerations**).
6.  **Validation**: Conduct a final end-to-end test simulating real-world user scenarios and data conditions for each tier of features (MVP, Tier 2, Tier 3) before the official launch.

## Next Steps & Future Enhancements

1.  Plan future sprints to develop Tier 2 features such as enhanced OpenHands video reports and a recommendation engine (**Project Overview: Prioritization - Tier 2**).
2.  Prepare designs and requirements for Tier 3 features like the full Apify suite integration and forecast engine (**Project Overview: Prioritization - Tier 3**).
