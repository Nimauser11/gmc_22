# Backend Structure Document

This document provides a clear and comprehensive overview of the backend setup for KPIx, the Taylor Swift-inspired AI Growth Coach. It outlines the architecture, database management, API design, hosting solutions, infrastructure components, security measures, and maintenance practices that ensure the backend is scalable, reliable, and secure.

## 1. Backend Architecture

The backend is built using a modern, modular approach that supports our evolving needs. Key points include:

- **Framework & Language:**
  - Built with Node.js
  - Uses well-known design patterns and separation of concerns (routes, controllers, services, and repositories) for code clarity and maintainability

- **Design Patterns:**
  - MVC (Model-View-Controller) or similar approach that organizes code into logical layers
  - Service-oriented components to allow easy scaling and maintenance

- **Scalability & Performance:**
  - Designed with microservices in mind to facilitate growth and load management
  - Supports parallel processing and asynchronous operations, making it responsive even during high traffic moments

- **Maintainability:**
  - Modular codebase ensures that adding new features or debugging issues is straightforward
  - Consistent coding standards and extensive documentation for ease of onboarding

## 2. Database Management

Our backend relies on robust data management practices to handle structured business data and large media files. The main considerations include:

- **Relational Database:**
  - **PostgreSQL** is used as our primary SQL database
  - Chosen for its reliability, performance, and rich feature set

- **File Storage:**
  - **AWS S3** is used to store video reports (from OpenHands), backups, and other static assets

- **Data Handling Practices:**
  - Data is structured for quick querying and secure storage
  - Regular backups and monitoring of database health ensure data integrity and availability

## 3. Database Schema

Our data is organized to support a diverse range of features. Here is an overview of the database schema:

### Human Readable Format:

- **Users Table:** Stores user account details (name, email, role, authentication credentials, etc.) for Founders, Team Members, Investors, and Data Analysts.

- **KPIs Table:** Contains various growth and performance metrics aggregated from external sources such as Stripe, Shopify, GA, etc.

- **Integrations Table:** Keeps track of connected data sources and relevant API tokens for integrating services like Mixpanel, HubSpot, and others.

- **Reports Table:** Records information related to video reports and narrative insights generated by OpenHands and Langtrace.

- **Notifications Table:** Manages configuration and history of alerts (email, Slack, in-app) for user-specific notifications.

- **Audit Trails Table:** Logs all user activities and system events to support security and compliance requirements.

### Example SQL Schema (PostgreSQL):

-- Users Table
CREATE TABLE Users (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
  email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  role VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL, -- Roles like Founder, Team Member, Investor, Data Analyst
  password_hash TEXT NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

-- KPIs Table
CREATE TABLE KPIs (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id INTEGER REFERENCES Users(id),
  metric_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
  metric_value NUMERIC NOT NULL,
  recorded_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

-- Integrations Table
CREATE TABLE Integrations (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id INTEGER REFERENCES Users(id),
  service_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL, -- e.g., Stripe, Shopify, GA
  api_token TEXT NOT NULL,
  connected_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

-- Reports Table
CREATE TABLE Reports (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id INTEGER REFERENCES Users(id),
  report_type VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL, -- e.g., Video, Digest
  content TEXT,
  generated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

-- Notifications Table
CREATE TABLE Notifications (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id INTEGER REFERENCES Users(id),
  notification_type VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL, -- e.g., Email, Slack, In-App
  config JSONB, -- Configuration details
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

-- Audit Trails Table
CREATE TABLE AuditTrails (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id INTEGER REFERENCES Users(id),
  action VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
  details TEXT,
  action_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

## 4. API Design and Endpoints

KPIx uses well-designed RESTful APIs that act as a bridge between the frontend and backend. The APIs are built to be intuitive and reliable.

- **API Design Approach:**
  - RESTful endpoints ensure clear and predictable communication
  - Each endpoint is designed with stateless interactions for scalability

- **Key Endpoints Include:**
  - **/api/auth:** Manages user authentication and OAuth2 flows for secure logins
  - **/api/dashboard:** Retrieves aggregated KPI data for user-specific dashboards
  - **/api/reports:** Handles requests for generating and fetching video and narrative reports
  - **/api/integrations:** Connects to various external APIs and manages data synchronization
  - **/api/notifications:** Configures and retrieves user notifications (email, Slack, in-app)
  - **/api/audit:** Logs and retrieves audit trail data for security and compliance

## 5. Hosting Solutions

KPIx backend is hosted on a cloud platform providing robust scalability and reliability. Details include:

- **Cloud Provider:**
  - Hosted on AWS
  - Utilizes AWS services such as EC2 for compute, RDS for PostgreSQL, and S3 for storage

- **Benefits of This Approach:**
  - High reliability and uptime with geographically distributed data centers
  - Scalability to handle growth in users and data
  - Cost-effective pay-as-you-go pricing model
  - Integrated security and monitoring tools to ensure smooth operation

## 6. Infrastructure Components

To ensure optimal performance and service continuity, the backend infrastructure includes several essential components:

- **Load Balancers:** Distribute incoming API requests evenly across servers, reducing downtime

- **Caching Mechanisms:** Use in-memory caches to store frequent queries, improving response time

- **Content Delivery Network (CDN):** Accelerates the delivery of static assets (videos, images) ensuring quick load times globally

- **API Gateways:** Manage API traffic, enforce security policies, and provide insights into API usage

- **File Storage:** AWS S3 is used for storing video reports and other static content

## 7. Security Measures

Security is at the forefront of KPIx's backend setup. Comprehensive practices are in place to protect data and maintain user trust:

- **Authentication & Authorization:**
  - OAuth2 is implemented for secure user logins
  - Role-based user management ensures that each role (Founder, Team Member, Investor, Data Analyst) has proper access

- **Data Encryption:**
  - All data transmissions use TLS 1.2+ encryption
  - Sensitive data in the database is encrypted using AES-256

- **Zero Trust Architecture:** Ensures that no implicit trust is granted, even within internal systems

- **Audit Trails:** Logs all significant user actions and system events for accountability

- **Compliance:** Adheres to data protection regulations with strict consent-driven integrations

## 8. Monitoring and Maintenance

To keep the backend running smoothly and troubleshoot any emerging issues, the following practices are used:

- **Monitoring Tools:**
  - AWS CloudWatch and similar monitoring services keep track of system performance and alerts
  - Regular health checks and error logging at every service level

- **Maintenance Strategies:**
  - Routine updates and patches to the Node.js environment and PostgreSQL database
  - Backup and disaster recovery plans in place to handle unforeseen issues

- **Performance Optimization:**
  - Automated scaling solutions ensure that the system adapts to changing loads
  - Continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines help in rolling out updates without downtime
