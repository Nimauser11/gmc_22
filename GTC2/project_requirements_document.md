# KPIx Project Requirements Document

## 1. Project Overview

KPIx is a Taylor Swift-inspired AI Growth Coach designed to transform the way startup founders and growth leaders see and use their data. It takes multiple data sources—including Stripe, Shopify, Google Analytics, LinkedIn, social media, and more—and converts raw numbers into engaging, narrative-driven insights. Imagine having a personal growth strategist who not only highlights what’s working but also tells the story behind every metric, turning dashboards into a stage where key performance indicators shine like hit tracks on a chart-topping album.

Built with style and strategic intelligence, KPIx exists to solve the problem of overwhelming dashboards and fragmented data. It empowers resource-constrained founders and marketing leaders to quickly make data-driven decisions, impress investors with regular updates, and streamline repetitive reporting tasks. At its core, KPIx aims for an intuitive user experience where growth insights are both actionable and emotionally uplifting—mixing hard analytics with creative storytelling to fuel sustainable business growth.

## 2. In-Scope vs. Out-of-Scope

**In-Scope:**

*   A unified growth dashboard that pulls data from multiple sources (Stripe, Shopify, GA, LinkedIn, social media channels, and email platforms).

*   Onboarding and user authentication processes that enable account linking and role-based dashboard personalization.

*   Integration of three core modules:

    *   **OpenHands:** Auto-generates personalized, founder-led video reports based on KPI insights.
    *   **Apify:** Scrapes and analyses competitor data to generate actionable recommendations.
    *   **Langtrace:** Provides a natural language interface for users to query and understand their performance metrics.

*   Role-based access and permissions for Founders, Growth/Marketing Teams, Investors, and Data Analysts.

*   Customizable notifications and reporting delivered via email, Slack, in-app alerts, and integrated video reports.

*   Baseline security measures such as encryption (TLS for transit, AES-256 for data at rest), OAuth2 integrations, and role-based access controls.

**Out-of-Scope:**

*   Advanced forecasting engines and AI-driven predictive analytics (to be added post-MVP).
*   Extensive post-MVP integrations beyond the core and additional listed data sources—integrations with platforms like HubSpot, Salesforce, Mixpanel, or Amplitude may be considered in later phases.
*   Fully customizable white-label dashboards or deeply branded investor decks—the initial release will offer a solid, Taylor Swift-inspired design aesthetic without enterprise-grade customization.
*   Deep collaboration features like task assignment or team collaboration layers beyond basic role-based views.
*   Internationalization or multi-language support in the first release.

## 3. User Flow

When a user (typically an early- to mid-stage startup founder or a growth leader) lands on KPIx, they are welcomed by an engaging, Taylor Swift-themed sign-up page. The onboarding flow begins with a simple authentication process using email or linked third-party accounts (OAuth2 for platforms like Google, LinkedIn, etc.). Once authenticated, the user is prompted to connect their critical data sources—Stripe, Shopify, GA, LinkedIn, and selected social media platforms. They then define their current growth focus by choosing an “era” (for example, launch-focused or long-term brand building), which personalizes their dashboard experience.

After setup, the user lands on a dynamic dashboard organized like tracks on an album. This dashboard displays clearly segmented KPIs across key funnel stages (awareness, engagement, conversion, retention) in a visually captivating layout. They can interact with various modules—exploring narrative-driven insights via Langtrace, watching auto-generated video reports via OpenHands, or checking real-time competitor trends powered by Apify. Throughout their session, notifications and scheduled reporting help guide their attention to critical insights, ensuring they never miss a beat in their growth story.

## 6. Non-Functional Requirements

*   **Performance:**

    *   Fast load times (target < 2 seconds) for dashboard rendering, especially given real-time data integration from multiple channels.
    *   Near real-time processing for alerts and notifications (within a few minutes of detecting an anomaly).

*   **Security:**

    *   Enforce zero-trust principle with least privilege access.
    *   Use TLS 1.2+ for all data communications and AES-256 for encrypting data at rest.
    *   Ensure OAuth2-based integrations, multi-factor authentication (MFA) for critical user access, and audit trails for sensitive operations.

*   **Scalability:**

    *   Designed to handle increasing loads as users add more data integrations and real-time reporting.
    *   Modular architecture to allow for plugins of additional integrations (e.g., HubSpot, Salesforce) in later phases.

*   **Usability:**

    *   Intuitive UX with Taylor Swift-inspired storytelling elements.
    *   Responsive design across devices so that dashboards and video reports look great on both desktop and mobile.

*   **Compliance:**

    *   Adhere to GDPR and CCPA with proper data consent flows, data export options, and privacy protection mechanisms.
    *   Record audit trails and user activity logs for security and compliance monitoring.

## 7. Constraints & Assumptions

*   **Dependencies:**

    *   Successful integration with external APIs (Stripe, Shopify, GA, LinkedIn, social media platforms) is crucial—APIs must be available and perform reliably.
    *   Availability and performance of integrated AI models (e.g., GPT-4o for Langtrace) as assumed based on current industry standards.

*   **Technical Limitations:**

    *   Real-time data syncing from multiple sources may experience minor latency; design must handle temporary data discrepancies gracefully.
    *   Role-based data segregation must be rigorously maintained especially in multi-team environments to protect sensitive information.

*   **Assumptions:**

    *   End users (i.e., startup founders and growth leaders) will have basic familiarity with dashboards and data tools.
    *   The MVP will focus on the foundational features with later expansion on advanced features like forecasting engines and full competitor intelligence.
    *   Initial user load is assumed to be modest, with scalability built in for growth as the user base expands.

## 8. Known Issues & Potential Pitfalls

*   **API Rate Limits & Reliability:**

    *   External APIs (e.g., from Stripe, Shopify, social media) may enforce rate limits or experience downtime. To mitigate this, include robust error-handling, caching mechanisms, and fallback scenarios.

*   **Data Integration Complexity:**

    *   Handling real-time updates across disparate data sources can lead to inconsistencies or delays in the unified dashboard. A well-defined data synchronization strategy with regular audits is essential.

*   **Security Risks:**

    *   With sensitive business metrics involved, stringent security measures must be maintained. Regular security audits and testing (including penetration testing) will help avoid vulnerabilities.

*   **User Experience Challenges:**

    *   Balancing a highly stylized, Taylor Swift-inspired aesthetic with clear, actionable data could prove challenging. Iterative user testing and feedback loops will be necessary to ensure clarity and usability.

*   **Dependency on AI Modules:**

    *   The accuracy of natural language responses from Langtrace and the storytelling quality of OpenHands videos are subject to AI model performance. Continuous training, fine-tuning, and performance monitoring will be important to maintain a consistent user experience.
